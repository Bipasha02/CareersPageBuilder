### How I Used AI Tools
I used ChatGPT as a reference and learning companion while building this project.  
It helped me understand certain backend concepts in **FastAPI**, clarify React-related syntax, and resolve debugging issues more efficiently.  
The overall design, structure, and final implementation were decided and coded by me after understanding each part.

### Key Prompts and Refinements
- Asked questions about handling **POST requests** and JSON parsing in FastAPI.
- Looked up how to correctly connect a **Vite + React** frontend to a FastAPI backend.
- Used AI guidance to fix small CORS and dependency issues.
- Referred to suggestions for improving file structure and writing cleaner documentation.

---

### What I Learned
- Strengthened my understanding of how APIs communicate between frontend and backend.
- Learned to debug issues in FastAPI more systematically.
- Improved React component organization and state management practices.
- Understood version control workflows while preparing the GitHub and deployment setup.

### Reflections
AI tools acted like a helpful guide during the learning and debugging process,  
but the logic, structure, and implementation decisions were my own.  
It made the overall workflow faster while allowing me to focus on understanding *why* something works, not just *how*.
